# Kaggle Titanic Prediction

## Motivation
My goal it's to solve most of the machine learning projects of this [Medium artcile](https://medium.com/projectpro/20-machine-learning-projects-that-will-get-you-hired-in-2021-a89473f2d2c7). I'm not following the sequencial order of the problems, but instead, I'm focusing on projects that make me experiment and try as many different techniques as possible.

For this project, my focus is to apply some Machine Learning techniques such as handling missing data and categorical data and experiment some classification models ir order to get the best score at Kaggle's competition.
